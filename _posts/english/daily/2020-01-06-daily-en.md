### Question     
How did the birth of Jesus Christ realize God's promise?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Genealogy of Jesus is recorded in Matthew. He descended from Abraham and David. He was of royal identity (1:1-18). 

+ Jesus was born of virgin Mary conceived by the Holy Spirit, as God promised (1:22-23). 

+ The Maji from the east followed God to see Jesus (2:1-12). 

+ Joseph led his family to Egypt to escape from Herod and later came back to Nazareth to live. All have been foretold by God's prophets (2:15-23). 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Every step of Jesus' birth fulfilled what God had said through His prophets. God's promises do not change because of man's weakness. Am I unable to let go of my worries? Let me see God's faithfulness, remember His promises, pray and ask Him to carry my burdens and take away my worries.
