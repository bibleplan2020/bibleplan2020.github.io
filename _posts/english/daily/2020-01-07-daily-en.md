### Question     
How did Jesus win over Satan's temptations?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ After Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, He came into scene in front of the Israelites. 

+ Jesus got baptized in water then went into the wilderness for forty days to be tempted by Satan. This was analogous to the Israelites where they went through the Red Sea and then wondered for forty years in the wilderness. However, Lord Jesus Christ won over all of Satan's temptations whereas the Israelites failed time after time. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** -Jesus faced same temptations as the Israelites: bodily necessities (food and water), testing God's will (Israelites went into Canaan without God), profit from Satan worshiping (golden calf, Baals). Israelites failed on all tests but Jesus won all with God's word. Jesus had set great examples for us to follow and be strengthened by Him so that we may win over temptations. What temptations have I won over through God? What temptations have I conceded to because I did not rely on God?
