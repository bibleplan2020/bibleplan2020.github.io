### Question     
What ability did Jesus show through the miracles He performed?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The chapters 8 and 9 record the miracles Jesus performed which displayed His great power had won over Satan's. 

+ Two independent contents were inserted in between the miracles: 1. The cost of following Jesus (8:18-22); 2. Opposition to Jesus and the beginning of His persecution (9:9-17). 

+ Jesus had compassion on the crowds when He saw them as lost sheeps without a shepherd which brought out the Great Commission in later chapters. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The power of Jesus is greater than Satan's. What challenges am I facing now? What power did Jesus show through the miracles He performed would allow me to see that none of the challenges I am facing is greater than God's authority? Jesus is merciful and has compassion on us who are lost. He is the good shepherd. How should I become familiar to His voice and follow Him to turn away from Satan's lies and troubles of the world? 

+ **Fidelity** - There's a price to pay to follow God. Am I willing to pay that price and commit myself to Him today?
