### Question     
What did Jesus commission the twelve disciples to do?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus sent out His twelve disciples to spread the Gospel, reminded them of the difficulties they will face, the cost of following Him, as well as God's presence, His equipping, and the rewards. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - What did God commission me to do? (see Matthew 28:18-20, Acts 1:8) What does Jesus's command to the disciples to preach Gospel remind me of in my service to the Lord? Am I relying on my own skills, money, or God alone? 

+ **Fidelity** - What does this attitude "freely you have received; freely give" (10:8) of preaching Gospel remind me? Do I have any reservation when preaching?
