### Question     
How did Jesus reveal his identify through answering John and Pharisees?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus answered John the Baptist's question while he was in prison. Jesus also explained to the crowds about John's identity and God's plan where heaven is for those who follow Jesus, not by one's own efforts. Jesus denounced the towns' people for they did not repent and then invited all to rest their souls in Him. 

+ Jesus performed miracle during Sabbath to show He is the Lord of the Sabbath. He truly satisfied the law on Sabbath. Jesus rebuked Pharisees' remark that Jesus was from the Beelzebul. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus told John the Baptist: "Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me." Some gained faith after seeing God's deeds while others wavered and fell. May God bless me with ever strengthened faith. 

+ **Identity** - Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. I can bring all my burdens to Jesus and ask what it means to be gentle and humble. What does it mean to take His yoke, and what should I learn from Him?
