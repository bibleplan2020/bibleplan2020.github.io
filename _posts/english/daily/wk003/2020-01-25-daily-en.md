### Question     
How was Jesus resurrected and what were His commands afterward?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Gospel of Matthew reaches the climax. The rise of Christ from resurrection is central to the Christian belief. 

+ Jesus' salvation is fully displayed in the reversal of His death on the cross. 

+ Jesus' great commission to His disciples and His promise that He would be with us until the end of the age. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus' resurrection helps us to believe that those who take faith in Him will have eternal life. Is my life reflecting that belief or am I living only for my earthly life? 

+ **Fidelity** - The great commission to the disciples is to make disciples of all people. What in my service is taking part of that great commission? Am I living out the calling of the great commission?
