### Question     
How did Jesus enter Jerusalem?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus entered Jerusalem gloriously and drove out those traders who desecrated the temple. 

+ The sandwich-structured writing indicates the connection between the curse of fig tree and clearing of the temple courts which might be viewed as Jesus' prediction of the temple and Israel. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus said it would be ours whatever we ask for in prayer and believe that we have received (11:24.) Do I understand the relationship between my faith and identity? Do I understand why faith can move mountain? 

+ **Integrity** - Instead of worshiping, the temple was being used by thieves as hiding place of their evil acts. Our bodies as God's temple may also be desecrated by our sinning nature. Do I have any thoughts or behaviors need to be cleansed by the Holy Spirit?
