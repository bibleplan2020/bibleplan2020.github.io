### Question     
What happened to Jesus after His arrest?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Pilate could find no accusation against Jesus. 

+ The Jews were rather release Barabbas than Jesus. 

+ Jesus was crucified along with two rubbers on the cross, mocked by the crowds, and laid in a tomb cut out of rock after death. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - After Jesus drew His last breath, the curtain in the temple was torn in two from top down which signified the end of separation of God and man. Am I able to let go of my guilt and despair to come in front of God fearlessly as my own father, to accept His mercy and discipline? Do I have anything to ask from Him? 

+ **Integrity** - The chief priest, filled with Jealousy, instigated the crowds to ask for Barabbas' release instead of Jesus. Do I continue to falter on certain things? Pray and ask the Holy Spirit to soften my heart to atone in front of God and let His love embrace me.
