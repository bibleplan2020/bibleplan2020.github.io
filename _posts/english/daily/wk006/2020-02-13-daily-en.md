### Question     
How did John the Baptist preach in the wilderness? Who were Jesus' ancestors?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ John the Baptist preached in the wilderness, baptized people, and was locked up in prison by Herod. 

+ Jesus' genealogy traced all the way back to Adam. 

+ Jesus won over the temptations from the devil in the wilderness. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Jesus used God's word to fend off the devil's temptations in the wilderness. Am I living in God's word or in cultural traditions and societal norm? Am I capable of fending off devil's temptations? 

+ **Fidelity** - John the Baptist faithfully completed the mission God gave him to pave the way for the Messiah. Do I understand my missions in life? Am I willing to follow God's will faithfully?
