### Question     
How did Jesus call His first disciples?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus called the first disciples. 

+ Jesus cleansed the leper and healed the paralyzed. 

+ The Pharisees conflicted with Jesus for He healed during Sabbath. Jesus called Himself the Lord of the Sabbath.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus proclaimed Himself as the Lord of the Sabbath because only God can give us true rest. Am I able to rest in God's peace when facing the stress of life and being judged by values of the world? 

+ **Community** - The friends of the paralyzed went extraordinary length to help him. Have I gone the extra mile for my fellow Christians? Can I become the blessing of someone in particular?  

+ **Fidelity** - Jesus called on the disciples to fish for people. Am I proclaiming gospel for the Lord to win over the souls of people?
